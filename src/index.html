						<p>This chart shows every freedom of information (FOI) request submitted to the provincial government from 2010 to Oct. 4, 2021. <span class="blue-01">‘General’</span> requests are those seeking information on government operations, data or other non-personal information.<br><br><span class="benton-ital">Scroll for more...</span></p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>We will remove ‘personal’ FOI requests from the analysis, since the Premier has said the current bill will not consider fees for personal information, only requests for government info.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>Here we can see what kind of groups are filing FOI requests. <span class="blue-01">Political parties</span> have always made up a significant portion of requests. That jumped from 2018-2020, and is a key reason cited by the NDP for the need to limit FOI requests.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>The amendments could have a chilling effect on the many non-political groups that routinely request information from the government, including <span class="blue-03">individuals</span>, <span class="green-01">media</span> and <span class="grey-03">other</span> groups such as law firms, businesses, researchers and others.</p>
						<p>Requests from non-political parties have not increased alongside those form political parties, leading some critics to suggest that the public will be the ones paying the price over a fight between political parties.</p>
